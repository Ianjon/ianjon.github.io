### A little bit about myself

Hi! My name is Ianjon Brower and Iâ€™m working for ASRC-Federal and GINA this summer. My project for this summer is going to be prototyping a Raspberry Pi with specific sensors that monitor the temperature (and other things) of ice cellars that is easy for anyone to use! These ice cellars are in native villages such as Utqiagvik, Nuiqsut, and many more.  The reason we need to do this work is that some of the ice cellars have been filling up with water by melting and this is ruining their storage for all year round. 

Ice cellars have been around for centuries to the Alaskan Natives. They're used to store an abudant amount of hunted game food for the year(s) so that it doesn't go bad. Imagine those large ice chest freezers, but then multiply the storage space by about 10, but requires no power because of the permafrost.
