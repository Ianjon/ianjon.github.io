Hi! My name is Ianjon Brower and Iâ€™m working for ASRC-Federal and GINA this summer. My project for this summer is going to be prototyping a Raspberry Pi with specific sensors that monitor the temperature (and other things) of ice cellars that is easy for anyone to use! These ice cellars are in native villages such as Utqiagvik, Nuiqsut, and many more.  The reason we need to do this work is that some of the ice cellars have been filling up with water by melting and this is ruining their storage for all year round. 

Ice cellars have been around for centuries to the Alaskan Natives. They're used to store an abudant amount of hunted game food for the year(s) so that it doesn't go bad. Imagine those large ice chest freezers, but then multiply the storage space by about 10, but requires no power because of the permafrost. 

The sensors are going to be fitted with a SENSE Hat that will record temperature,humidty, and pressure. Also with an attached screen so that hunters can view the log of that days temperature and be able to compare it to last weeks. Depending on the area of the cellar, some may have to be fit with an external power source that may be powered by large batters( D sized/laptop battery). Most, if not all ice cellars have a ladder within them. With that being said, the Raspberry pi is going to be enclosed into a container, with air vents so that the sensors can pick up on the readings, and then mounted onto the ladder at the base for the most accurate temperature .
