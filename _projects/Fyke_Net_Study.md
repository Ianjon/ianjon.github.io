I was working with other biologists from the North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management during the summers of 2012,2013,2014. The net is set out during summer and set up either mid June or early July depending on ice conditions. The first image is what it looks like out of the water while the image on the right is when it is in use. When the net is up and running, it is checked daily. Some days you'll have 30 or so fish, other days you'll have near a thousand, but the average amount is typically 200-500 fish. Fish are then moved by the sections, lifting up the one near the front funnel to be put into the next sections until the end, where they are coming out of the net into a floating type basket net to individually grab and take notes. This process needs at least 3 people. Here's an example on how they're recorded. Some are then taken back to the lab for further research.
