I helped with this project in the years 2012,2013,2014. The project main objectives were to genetically identify bears that use bowhead whale carcasses through the hair snares and microsatellite DNA.Also to determine visation rates, if high enough, to make population estimates using mark recapture feasible. Then compare with the bone piles of Kaktovik and Utqiagvik(Barrow). The hair snare is put up at the most northern place of Alaska. It's not where the dot is, but left of that dot. The image with the bears was taken with a camera that was setup there. The camera setup has stopped since bears tend to either destroy or knock down/ play the post holding the motion activated camera.

The method of putting up the fence is that each post is roughly 10 meters apart from each other and the fence height is only .5 meters so that they can easily go over it. The spacing for same hair sampling is .75 meters apart when multiple hairs on clumped in an area. Fence is checked about every other day and if there is a bear in sight, we don't approach and turn back to the college(where NSB-DWM is stationed).It is set high enougn so that foxe hair isn't included. The buddy system is a must along with both people having proper gun training provided by NSB-DWM. Sometimes seagulls/ravens tend to get things on the wire and we clean it off with a blow torch. The hair samples are then stored in manilla envelopes, each envelope representing one bear.
