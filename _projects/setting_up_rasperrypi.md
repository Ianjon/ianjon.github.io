So here's a link to download the operating system onto the SD card/micro SD card if it doesn't come with it installed or it manages to go very wrong. 
The link also helps with your first install of the operating system. (Picture below is the operating system to pick)
(https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/2/) 

Install the raspbian OS and there you have it, a working little mini computer.

The next step is to open the home button, which should be at the top left side of the screen. Scroll to preferences and change your keyboard layout to English US (Default is british layout, which can make you go a little crazy.)
