June 14, 2017: 
Managed to create a external power source for my raspberry pi to power it. The down arrow indicates that the temperature is lower than the last recorded temp.

June 14,2017:
Update on Battery Pack: 4 D sized duracell batteries( To my conclusion that they're 14,000 mAh batteries) last about 19 hours while doing two recordings. One to a text file while the other uploaded it to an underground weather station. 

Got a graph working at the moment for temperature and time. Working on making it so that it'll update the graph by itself instead of having to re-run the program to get an updated graph.

June 16, 2017: Social meadia post. Got contacted from an NSB-Mayors office persononel asking to send as a widespread email across the northslope

Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission manager/employee asking if she could try and get us on the agenda for a meeting being held her in fairbanks in the month of July about the projects. As in try and present it at AEWC. 

June 19,2017: Figuring out why matplotlib.pyplot isn't functioning on the pi. Function runs but the inteded source that I followed shows a live graph, while mine just shows a blank screen. 

June 20, 2017: With the help of Ross a bit, I got the code to work on python 2.7.9 for a live graph running but not for python 3. 

June 21, 2017: Copy and pasted the code for python 3 into a python 2 script and changed a weee bit on the code to get proper temperature.
