June 14, 2017: 
Managed to create a external power source for my raspberry pi to power it. The down arrow indicates that the temperature is lower than the last recorded temp.

June 14,2017:
Update on Battery Pack: 4 D sized duracell batteries( To my conclusion that they're 14,000 mAh batteries) last about 19 hours while doing two recordings. One to a text file while the other uploaded it to an underground weather station. 

Got a graph working at the moment for temperature and time. Working on making it so that it'll update the graph by itself instead of having to re-run the program to get an updated graph.

June 16, 2017: Social meadia post. Got contacted from an NSB-Mayors office persononel asking to send as a widespread email across the northslope

Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission manager/employee asking if she could try and get us on the agenda for a meeting being held her in fairbanks in the month of July about the projects. As in try and present it at AEWC. 

June 19,2017: Figuring out why matplotlib.pyplot isn't functioning on the pi. Function runs but the inteded source that I followed shows a live graph, while mine just shows a blank screen. 

June 20, 2017: With the help of Ross a bit, I got the code to work on python 2.7.9 for a live graph running but not for python 3. 

June 21, 2017: Copy and pasted the code for python 3 into a python 2 script and changed a weee bit on the code to get proper temperature.

June 26,2017: First time messing around with a raspberry pi bread board and getting to know some of it's features. Trying/going to implement a cat 5 cable so that we can put a sensor into the cellars without the pi having to be down there itself. Also finished my first draft for a questionaire to ask the public about their ice cellars so that we can get an idea of what materials we need for some and what materials we need for the length of cables. 

June 29, 2017: Messing around with the DHT11 sesnor and kinda fried it because I didn't know the breadboard needed a resistor. Met up with Vladimir R. . Back and forth on the project and ideas of to exapnd into different projects, such as permafrost ice. Was a little surprised when I told him I got a large community feedback that people are interested. Overall said this project looks very good. So woo! Looking at my presentation and I'm wondering what else to add to it....
