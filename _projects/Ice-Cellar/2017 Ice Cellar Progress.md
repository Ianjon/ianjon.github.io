Managed to create a external power source for my raspberry pi to power it. The down arrow indicates that the temperature is lower than the last recorded temp.

Update on Battery Pack: 4 D sized duracell batteries( To my conclusion that they're 14,000 mAh batteries) last about 19 hours while doing two recordings. One to a text file while the other uploaded it to an underground weather station. 

Got a graph working at the moment for temperature and time. Working on making it so that it'll update the graph by itself instead of having to re-run the program to get an updated graph.
