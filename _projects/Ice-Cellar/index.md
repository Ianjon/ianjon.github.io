# 2017 Ice Celler Log

## June 19,2017: 
Figuring out why [matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html) isn't functioning on the pi. Function runs but the inteded source that I followed shows a live graph, while mine just shows a blank screen. 

## June 16, 2017: 
Social meadia post. Got contacted from an NSB-Mayors office persononel asking to send as a widespread email across the northslope

Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission manager/employee asking if she could try and get us on the agenda for a meeting being held her in fairbanks in the month of July about the projects. As in try and present it at AEWC. 

## June 14, 2017: 
* Managed to create a external power source for my raspberry pi to power it. The down arrow indicates that the temperature is lower than the last recorded temp.  ![Here's the image](http://i.imgur.com/ujtKcgH.jpg)  
* Update on Battery Pack: 4 D sized duracell batteries( To my conclusion that they're 14,000 mAh batteries) last about 19 hours while doing two recordings. One to a text file while the other uploaded it to an underground weather station. 
* Got a graph working at the moment for temperature and time. Working on making it so that it'll update the graph by itself instead of having to re-run the program to get an updated graph. ![Raspberry Pi Image](http://i.imgur.com/MFdY0VO.png)
