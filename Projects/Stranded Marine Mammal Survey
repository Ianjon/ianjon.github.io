# Stranded Marine Mammal Survey

Made and presented this poster at the Alaska Marine Science Symposium in 2015. Right click and open in a new window if you would like to look at it, as it makes it easier to read. I worked on this project during the summers of 2012,2013,2014. It usually starts around mid to late June and goes to about October or until the ice comes in. For northern survevialance, started off at NSB-DWM shore area, following the coast all the way up to Point Barrow and back. For down the coast, same starting area to Skull Cliffs.  As you can see in the poster, the main method of transportation is by four wheelers and some areas you have to come out with chest waders to check the depth and hardness of creeks so that you don't get stuck.

 Documentation is done by filling out a form and taking a picture of the diseased animal with the tag on. Every carcass without a tag gets a form and tag applied while living animals are filled out with the form and just taking a picture of them. Living or dead is also marked by gps. The carcasses vary a lot as you can tell by some of the pictures. Animals that commonly show up that aren't listed are: ringed seals, bearded seals, walrus, birds, foxes. The hazzards that are in this project are machine breakdowns, deep water crossings, polar bear encounters and the weather. The buddy system is used here incase you or your co-workers machine decides not to work anymore. Gun training is mandatory for all those that follow out because you can encounter polar bear(s). If the carcass of a seal is found, it is usually brought to the attention of the necropsy biologist, which is either brought back or the necropsy is done there with samples going back to the lab. 

The land mark is Skull Cliffs and is a reference to how far away from Barrow it is. It's about a 30 mile drive south of Barrow. Usually bring a 5 gallon gas canistar for safety reasons, don't want to be stranded out there with just a shotgun, some data documentation, and a gps.
